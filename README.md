# ECE247 Final Project

In this project, we forecast the USD-Euro exchange rate using historical data of the exchange rate and other economic indicators, such as interest rates, comsumer price indices, and commodity prices, to name a few.
Our primary architectures are recurrent neural networks compared against a baseline linear regression model.
